NGG Greggs
Flutter Work Demonstration

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Hello World flutter base example so
that it can add a Greggs Sausage Roll to a basket. 

This will read the json file called 'data.json'.
Then it converts the json to an object called 'Item'.

There are 3 screens in total,
  - HomeScreen
  - Item Detailed Screen 
  - Basket Screen 

Every time you press the add buy button on the item detailed screen, an item will get added to the basket. 

Basket screen will show all the items that has been added and the total price of them.
